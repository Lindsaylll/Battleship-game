## Comment: everything works fine excepted for rotation, so I disabled rotation
#### rotation can be turned on by simply comment out that chunk which is 
indicated in Movable file
## Enhancement
#### added image for ship, when we move/place ship, we will deal with the real image instead of the rectangels
